Project 1

Overview
This project consisted in the exploration of a provided database movie rentals in which the student had to run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of the student's queries.

For the presentation component, I had to create four slides, and each should have

(c) A supporting visualization created using the final data of the SQL queries that answer the questions of interest
(d) A small summary on each slide.
